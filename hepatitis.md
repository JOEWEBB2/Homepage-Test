What is Hepatitis?

Hepatitis is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis virus which could be easily contracted from a victim through contact of body fluids. This could be either through sexual contact, blood contact or even saliva. It could also be contracted if by chance a person consumes the waste passed out from a carrier. Slight contact with these fluids can transmit the disease.Â 

Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. The liver is a vital organ that processes nutrients, filters the blood and fights infections. When the liver is inflamed or damaged, its functions can be affected. Hepatitis is commonly caused by a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis such as heavy alcohol use, toxins, some medications, and certain medical conditions.

Viral infections of the liver that are classified as hepatitis include hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of virally transmitted hepatitis

Â If not treated with caution, this hepatitis virus would gradually grow into a more severe state which results in scarring of the liver, abnormal functionality of the liver and in due time, chronic hepatitis, liver cancer or cirrhosis.
